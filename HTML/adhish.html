     <p>
      Hello and welcome! I'm
      <strong>
       Adhish Bhandari
      </strong>
      , a passionate and curious learner currently pursuing a
      <strong>
       BSc (Hons) in Computing with Artificial Intelligence
      </strong>
      . My journey into the world of technology began with a fascination for how machines think and how we, as humans, can teach them to understand and respond more intelligently.
     </p>
     <p>
      My academic path is rooted in a blend of computing fundamentals and AI-driven problem-solving. Through my degree program, I’ve been introduced to key areas like programming, data analysis, machine learning, and intelligent systems. Among these, I’ve developed a growing interest in how AI can be used to enhance human creativity and communication. I have foundational experience working with
      <strong>
       Python
      </strong>
      for scripting and data handling, and
      <strong>
       SQL
      </strong>
      for working with databases. These tools have enabled me to approach real-world problems with both structure and logic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside of academics, I’m a firm believer that creativity feeds innovation. That’s why I actively immerse myself in the arts. My hobbies include
      <strong>
       sketching, painting, doodling
      </strong>
      , and creating visual stories that reflect emotion and expression. I find that visual art and computing have a unique intersection — both require vision, patience, and a problem-solving mindset.
     </p>
     <p>
      Music is another big part of my life. I enjoy listening to a wide range of genres, and I’m also a performer. I sing and play several
      <strong>
       percussion instruments
      </strong>
      , which has helped me develop rhythm, collaboration skills, and the discipline that comes with regular practice. Music, much like coding, requires timing, structure, and flow — qualities I bring to both my personal and professional projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’ve also had the opportunity to take on roles beyond the classroom. As the
      <strong>
       Social Media Manager for my high school’s MUN (Model United Nations) program
      </strong>
      , I was responsible for designing, scheduling, and managing content that engaged students and built community participation. That experience taught me the importance of digital storytelling and online presence — something I now value in both academic and professional spheres.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’ve also participated in the
      <strong>
       British Council's Video Making Competition
      </strong>
      , which allowed me to explore another side of creative filmmaking. Working on that project pushed me to script, shoot, and edit visual content under a deadline, enhancing my ability to plan, adapt, and deliver quality work even outside my comfort zone.
     </p>
     <p>
      Today, I’m actively working toward strengthening my technical foundation while staying deeply connected to my creative roots. I believe that the future belongs to those who can combine logical thinking with emotional intelligence, and my goal is to contribute to that future by building tools, stories, and solutions that matter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Whether I’m writing code, making music, designing visuals, or working with others, I bring a spirit of curiosity, empathy, and dedication to everything I do. I look forward to growing further in the field of computing and AI, while continuing to explore how creativity and technology can inspire real impact.
