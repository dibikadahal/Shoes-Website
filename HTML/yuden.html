      Hey! I’m
      <strong>
       Yuden Gurung
      </strong>
      , and if I had to sum myself up, I’d say I’m a dreamer with a keyboard, a gamer with a vision, and a tech student who’s still learning how to center a div without Googling it (we’ve all been there). I’m currently on an academic journey in computing, slowly but surely unlocking the world of programming, AI, and systems — and somewhere along the way, I found that I actually enjoy this madness.
     </p>
     <p>
      I wasn’t born into tech, but I definitely grew into it. At first, I was just another teenager obsessed with mobile games — the graphics, the strategies, the adrenaline of competition. But behind that obsession was something deeper: a curiosity about how it all worked. What made games feel alive? What made them so engaging? That curiosity led me down the rabbit hole of programming, where I began learning to create rather than just consume.
     </p>
     <p>
      I’ve participated in a
      <strong>
       college-level hackathon
      </strong>
      , and let me tell you — it’s one of the most intense and rewarding things I’ve done. Imagine staring at a blank screen with a team of equally sleep-deprived friends, trying to turn a vague idea into a functioning prototype before time runs out. It wasn’t just about typing code — it was about collaboration, iteration, and trusting your instincts when the clock is ticking. It pushed me beyond my comfort zone and gave me a glimpse into what it’s like to actually build something under pressure. I didn't win first place, but I walked away with something better — the thrill of creating.
     </p>
     <p>
      When I’m not coding (or at least pretending to), I’m probably deep into a mobile game or catching a football match — yes, even the ones that end 0-0 in the rain. Football has been a big part of my life. It’s not just entertainment — it teaches you rhythm, tactics, perseverance, and loyalty (even when your team loses 5 matches in a row). In a way, coding feels the same: sometimes you play well, sometimes you miss the goal, but the game always goes on.
     </p>
     <p>
      I like to think of myself as someone who's in the middle of figuring things out. I’m currently learning new technologies, writing messy but improving code, and working on small projects to get better one line at a time. I’m also becoming more aware of the ethics and responsibilities tied to tech — especially as AI continues to evolve. I want to be someone who contributes meaningfully, not just to the field, but to the people using what we create.
     </p>
     <p>
      My goal isn’t just to become a developer — it’s to be a developer who thinks critically, creates responsibly, and brings a bit of heart into the world of logic. Whether it’s through building an app, solving a real-world problem, or collaborating on a quirky project with friends, I want to keep learning, keep failing forward, and keep enjoying the ride.
