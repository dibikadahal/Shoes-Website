     <p>
      Hello! I'm
      <strong>
       Rujal
      </strong>
      , a tech enthusiast and creative thinker currently pursuing a
      <strong>
       BSc (Hons) in Computing with Artificial Intelligence
      </strong>
      at Islington College. I‚Äôve always been fascinated by the relationship between humans and machines ‚Äî how code can power solutions, influence decisions, and even mimic intelligence. My academic journey started at Nightingale International Secondary School, continued through Xavier International College for A-Levels, and has now brought me deeper into the world of intelligent systems, software design, and future-focused technologies.
     </p>
     <p>
      I began exploring programming in school, experimenting with Python and C, and quickly discovered the joy of turning logic into real results. Since then, I‚Äôve built a strong foundation in both languages and continue to improve through project-based learning. Alongside programming, I developed a passion for web development early on. I started working with HTML and CSS in Grade 7 and have been building, breaking, and fixing websites ever since ‚Äî from simple personal pages to functional layouts and UI components.
     </p>
     <p>
      My curiosity drives me to stay up to date with modern tech stacks and tools. I‚Äôm currently diving deeper into JavaScript and exploring frameworks that power today‚Äôs web applications. I love challenging myself to understand both the front-end and back-end sides of development, especially when it comes to AI integration in web environments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Outside the classroom, I‚Äôm someone who believes in a balanced life. I‚Äôm passionate about
      <strong>
       sports
      </strong>
      ‚Äî both watching and playing ‚Äî and I often find that physical activity helps sharpen my mental focus. I also enjoy music, sketching, painting, and creative brainstorming. Whether it‚Äôs through writing code, creating visuals, or collaborating on ideas, I value expressing myself and growing through creativity.
     </p>
     <p>
      My goal is to become a developer who doesn't just write efficient code, but one who builds things that are meaningful and impactful. I aim to contribute to real-world projects, particularly in the growing field of Artificial Intelligence ‚Äî whether that‚Äôs building smarter systems, designing intuitive user interfaces, or simply making people‚Äôs lives easier through technology.
     </p>
